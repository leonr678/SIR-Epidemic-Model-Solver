# SIR-Epidemic-Model-Solver
We solve for (and plot) SIR epidemic model in MATLAB, with parameters used from user inputs

# Usage

# Code

The code is structured into 3 files, 2 of them being functions and one being the implementation script (main.m). Upon running main.m, you will be required to input initial conditions and parameters. Then plots of the solutions will be displayed on a figure.

# Mathematics

To simulate epidemic spread, we use the SIR model, which consists of the 3 following ODEs:

dS/dt = -BIS

dI/dt = BIS - yI

dR/dt = yI
